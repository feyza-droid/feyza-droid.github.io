I am currently working on Baltic Sea modelling. I will share the details when I have more time.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/posts/baltic_sea_model_convgnp_prediction.png" title="Baltic Sea Model" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>
