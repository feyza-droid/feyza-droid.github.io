I am currently practicing Dynamic Programming problems taught by freeCodeCamp, one of my favorite resources on the internet. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBt53YbR9Kk">freeCodeCamp Dynamic Programming - Learn to Solve Algorithmic Problems & Coding Challenges</a>

## DP Problems List
<ul>
    <li>canSum ➡️ Can you do it? yes/no (Decision Problem) </li>
    <li>howSum ➡️ How will you do it? (Combinatoric Problem) </li>
    <li>bestSum ➡️ What is the best way to do it? (Optimization Problem) </li>
    <li>canConstruct ➡️ Can you do it? (with strings) </li>
    <li>countConstruct ➡️ How many different ways to do it? (with strings)</li>
    <li>allConstruct ➡️ What are the ways to do it? (with strings) </li>
</ul>

## How to solve with recursion & memoization?

1. Make it work
    - visualize the problem as a tree
    - implement the tree using recursion
    - test it

2. Make it efficient
    - add a memo object
    - add a base case to return memo values
    - store return values into the memo

## How to solve with tabulation?

- visualize the problem as a table
- size the table based on the inputs
- initialize the table with default values
- seed the trivial answer into the table
- iterate through the table
- fill further positions based on the current position
