I read Designing Machine Learning Systems occasionally and I would like to write what I learn from this book. Starting from the topic 'Handling the Lack of Labels'.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/posts/designing_machine_learning_systems.jpg" title="Designing Machine Learning Systems" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

<blockquote>
    TO-DO: write Handling the Lack of Labels (page 94). Weak supervision, Semi-supervision, Transfer Learning, Active learning.
