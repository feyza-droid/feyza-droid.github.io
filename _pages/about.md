Hello. I am Feyza Eksen, master of science student at Istanbul Technical University. I am interested in Coding and Reinforcement Learning in general.

Currently I am practicing Dynamic Programming problems and performing research by doing literature survey on Data Efficient Offline Reinforcement Learning.

I am very fond of learning 🤓 and reading 📗. I can play the violin a little :violin: and I know a little German 🇩🇪. I love cats, dogs and chicks 😻 🐕 🐥 , who doesn't! 🐾
