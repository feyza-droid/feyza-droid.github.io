Hello everyone! 🙋🏻‍♀️

My name is Feyza Eksen. I am currently a PhD student in Computer Science at The University of Rostock.

I am fond of learning new things 🤓 and reading books 📗. I can play the violin a little bit :violin: and know some German and I'm still learning it 🇩🇪. I love cats, dogs and chicks 😻 🐕 🐥 , who doesn't! 🐾
