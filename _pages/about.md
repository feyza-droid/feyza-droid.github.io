Hello. I am Feyza Eksen, Master of Science student at Istanbul Technical University. I am interested in coding and Reinforcement Learning in general.

Currently I am preparing a publication related to Data Efficient Offline Reinforcement Learning and solving LeetCode problems.

I am very fond of learning 🤓 and reading 📗. I can play the violin a little :violin: and I know a little German 🇩🇪. I love cats, dogs and chicks 😻 🐕 🐥 , who doesn't! 🐾
